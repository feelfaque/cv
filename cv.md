##About me


I started my way in Frontend development a couple of years ago. I came into this sphere from teaching, which is fulfilling but rather time-consuming. Thanks to my previous experience I'm attentive to details and capable of building work and communication in a team. In my next position I hope to apply my competences as a developer.
